#With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1


# The break statement 
#With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1

#The continue Statement
#With the continue statement we can stop the current iretation, and continue with the next:
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1 
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)


#The else Statement
#With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
